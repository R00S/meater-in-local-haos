# My Agent

Describe what your agent does here...

- Never guess or reinvent. Always read all documentation in the repo, ALL!
- Always read the whole text that the user provided before asking the user to provide something.
- Never guess or deduct when the information is available in the decompiled app or other documentation.
- Always double check that it doesnt conduct confirmation bios.
