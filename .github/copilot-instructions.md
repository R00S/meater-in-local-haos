## Quick Commands

```bash
# After editing panel-class-template.js OR cooking_data.py, regenerate:
cd custom_components/kitchen_cooking_engine
python3 generate_frontend_data.py

# Check current PANEL_VERSION (should match after regeneration):
grep "PANEL_VERSION" custom_components/kitchen_cooking_engine/const.py
grep "const PANEL_VERSION" custom_components/kitchen_cooking_engine/www/kitchen-cooking-panel.js
```

## What File to Edit for Each Change

| I want to change... | Source of Truth | Then run |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| UI buttons, graph, layout, behavior | `www/panel-class-template.js` | `python3 generate_frontend_data.py` |
| Meat/cut names, temperatures, doneness | `cooking_data.py` | `python3 generate_frontend_data.py` |
| Swedish meat data | `swedish_cooking_data.py` | `python3 generate_frontend_data.py` |
| Sensor attributes | `sensor.py` | - |
| Services | `sensor.py` + `services.yaml` | - |
| Config options | `config_flow.py` | - |

### ⚠️ DANGER: Duplicate Data

**NEVER** put cooking data (MEAT_CATEGORIES, DONENESS_OPTIONS, etc.) in panel-class-template.js!
- The template should only have UI code (the class definition)
- Cooking data constants are injected by the generator from the Python files
- If you duplicate data, it WILL get out of sync and cause bugs

---

## Project Overview

This is a Home Assistant custom integration for kitchen temperature cooking (MEATER probes, etc.). It provides:
- Temperature monitoring with cooking sessions
- Meat/protein selection with doneness levels
- Dynamic ETA calculation
- Notifications (mobile, TTS, persistent)
- Indicator light control
- Cook history with notes

## Key Files

### Backend (Python) - Sources of Truth
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cooking_data.py` | **SOURCE OF TRUTH** - International meat/cut/temp data |
| `swedish_cooking_data.py` | **SOURCE OF TRUTH** - Swedish meat/cut/temp data |
| `sensor.py` | Cooking session sensor entity |
| `const.py` | Constants including PANEL_VERSION |
| `generate_frontend_data.py` | Generates JS from template + data |
| `__init__.py` | Integration setup, panel registration |

### Frontend (JavaScript)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `www/panel-class-template.js` | **SOURCE OF TRUTH** - UI class code ONLY |
| `www/kitchen-cooking-panel.js` | **AUTO-GENERATED** - DO NOT EDIT |

---

## Version Numbering

Format: `v0.A.B.C`
- `0` = Beta
- `A` = Major feature batch
- `B` = Branch number — **increment when a new branch is created, reset C to 0**
- `C` = PR/release number within that branch — **increment for each new PR on the same branch**

### Digit bumping rules

| Situation | What to change | Example |
|---|---|---|
| New branch created | Bump `B`, reset `C` to `0` | `0.5.2.9` → `0.5.3.0` |
| New PR on same branch | Bump `C` only | `0.5.3.0` → `0.5.3.1` |
| Both never bump at once | Unless explicitly instructed | — |

### 🛑 MANDATORY: Version Update Checklist

**Every release MUST update ALL 4 version locations.** Mismatches cause broken releases.

When bumping the version (e.g. from `0.5.3.0` to `0.5.3.1`):

```
□ 1. manifest.json        → "version": "0.5.3.1"
□ 2. __init__.py           → __version__ = "0.5.3.1"
□ 3. __init__.py           → Last Change: v0.5.3.1 - <description>
□ 4. const.py              → Last Change: v0.5.3.1 - <description>
     (PANEL_VERSION is auto-incremented by generate_frontend_data.py)
```

**Quick verification command:**
```bash
grep '"version"' custom_components/kitchen_cooking_engine/manifest.json
grep '__version__' custom_components/kitchen_cooking_engine/__init__.py
grep 'PANEL_VERSION' custom_components/kitchen_cooking_engine/const.py
```

**All 3 version strings MUST match.** If they don't, fix them before committing.

This has caused failed releases multiple times (v0.5.0.72, v0.5.1.0) where code
changes were committed but version numbers were left stale or inconsistent.

---

## Testing

User tests via HACS:
1. Create a GitHub release from the branch
2. User downloads in HACS
3. User restarts Home Assistant

No automated tests exist - all testing is manual on real HAOS.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Editing kitchen-cooking-panel.js directly (it gets overwritten!)
2. ❌ Putting cooking data in panel-class-template.js (causes duplicates!)
3. ❌ Forgetting to run generate_frontend_data.py after editing
4. ❌ Forgetting to commit ALL changed files (template + generated + data)
5. ❌ Using deprecated HA APIs (check HA 2024.1.0+ compatibility)
6. ❌ **FABRICATING method/property names instead of reading the source code** (see below)

---

## 🛑 NEVER Fabricate Code — Always Read the Source First

**This is the #1 cause of failed releases.** AI agents tend to generate plausible-sounding
method names from patterns instead of reading the actual source code. This ALWAYS fails.

### The Rule
When writing ANY new code that calls existing methods or references existing properties:
1. **OPEN and READ the actual source file** where the method/property is defined
2. **FIND the real method name** by reading the code, not by guessing from patterns
3. **COPY the exact name** from the source into your new code

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Generate method names from naming patterns (e.g. seeing 15 `_get*` methods and inventing `_getEntities()`)
- ❌ Assume a method exists because "it should" or "it makes sense"
- ❌ Write code that references methods you haven't verified exist in the current codebase

### Why This Matters
In v0.5.0.66, the agent wrote `this._getEntities()` — a method that **does not exist anywhere
in the codebase**. It was fabricated from the dominant `_get*` naming pattern (15+ such methods).
The actual method is `_findCookingEntities()` which uses a completely different prefix.
This caused a TypeError crash and a failed release. The agent would have seen this immediately
if it had simply opened panel-class-template.js and read the method list.

### Success Rate Impact
| Approach | Success Rate |
|----------|-------------|
| Code where source was READ first | 80-95% |
| Code with FABRICATED names (guessed from patterns) | **0%** |

## Project Goals & Architecture (from SKILL.md)

### Terms of Reference (ToR)
- **Objective**: Develop a robust cooking engine that integrates seamlessly with a variety of kitchen appliances and enhances user experience.
- **Scope**: Cover multiple culinary processes, from preparation to cooking and cleanup.

### HAOS Compatibility Guidelines
- Ensure full compliance with Home Assistant Operating System (HAOS) standards.
- Use HAOS APIs for integration with other smart home devices.
- Maintain backward compatibility with previous HAOS versions.

### Data Separation Principles
- Ensure clear segregation of configuration, user data, and operational logs.
- Use designated folders for different data types within the application.
- Implement encryption where necessary to protect sensitive user information.

### Multi-appliance Support
- Design the system architecture to support various kitchen appliances regardless of manufacturer.
- Create abstraction layers to handle communication with different appliance protocols.
- Support appliance discovery using HAOS standard methods for a plug-and-play experience.

### Architecture
- Modular architecture that allows for easy updates and maintenance.
- Clear API documentation for all service interfaces.

### Development Workflows
- `main` for stable releases, feature branches for new development.
- CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

### Best Practices
- Follow coding standards to ensure code maintainability.
- Conduct code reviews to improve code quality.
- Document all APIs, workflows, and system components.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
