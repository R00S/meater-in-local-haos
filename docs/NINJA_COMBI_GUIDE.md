# Ninja Combi SFP700EU Cooking Guide

## Overview

The Ninja Combi (SFP700EU) is a versatile multi-function oven that combines several cooking methods in one appliance. This guide helps you understand how to use the oven effectively with your existing cooking knowledge.

## Core Cooking Modes (Use Standard Recipes)

These modes work exactly like their standalone counterparts. You can use any standard recipe designed for these methods:

### 1. Convection Oven Mode
- **What it does**: Traditional oven with fan-assisted heat distribution
- **Use for**: Roasting meats, baking, general oven cooking
- **Tray positions**: Follow recipe (usually middle rack for even cooking)
- **Temperature**: Use standard oven temperatures from recipes
- **Tips**: Works exactly like a regular convection oven

### 2. Air Fryer Mode
- **What it does**: Rapid hot air circulation for crispy results
- **Use for**: Frying without oil, crispy vegetables, wings, fries
- **Tray positions**: Use crisper tray on lower position for best air circulation
- **Temperature**: Use standard air fryer recipes (typically 175-200°C)
- **Tips**: No preheating needed, gives same results as standalone air fryers

### 3. Steamer Mode
- **What it does**: Steam cooking with water reservoir
- **Use for**: Vegetables, fish, dumplings, rice
- **Tray positions**: Use steamer tray, fill water tank to indicated level
- **Temperature**: Typically 100°C (steam temperature)
- **Tips**: Healthier cooking method, preserves nutrients and moisture

### 4. Proving Mode
- **What it does**: Low-temperature environment for dough rising
- **Use for**: Bread dough, pizza dough, pastries
- **Tray positions**: Middle rack with dough in bowl
- **Temperature**: 30-40°C depending on recipe
- **Tips**: Maintains consistent warm temperature for optimal yeast activity

## Modified Recipe Modes (Recipe Adaptation Required)

These modes require modifications to standard recipes for best results in the Ninja Combi:

### 5. Searing/Sautéing Mode
- **Modifications needed**: 
  - Use oven-safe pan on crisper tray
  - Higher initial temperature than stovetop (preheat to 230°C)
  - Shorter cooking times due to enclosed heat
  - Add small amount of oil to prevent sticking
- **Best for**: Searing steaks, browning meat before braising
- **Tray position**: Lower rack for maximum heat

### 6. Grilling Mode
- **Modifications needed**:
  - Direct high heat from top element
  - Position food closer to element than traditional oven broil
  - Flip halfway through for even char
  - Watch carefully to prevent burning
- **Best for**: Steaks, burgers, vegetables with char
- **Tray position**: Upper rack for intense heat

### 7. Rice/Pasta Cooker Mode
- **Modifications needed**:
  - Use water ratio specific to Ninja Combi (see manual)
  - Sealed oven-safe pot with lid
  - Different timing than stovetop (typically 20-30 min for rice)
  - No stirring needed during cooking
- **Best for**: Rice, pasta, grains
- **Tray position**: Middle rack

### 8. Slow Cooking Mode
- **Modifications needed**:
  - Use oven-safe covered pot or Dutch oven
  - Temperature typically 85-95°C (lower than standard oven)
  - Liquid ratios may differ (less evaporation)
  - Extended cook times (4-8 hours)
- **Best for**: Stews, braised meats, pot roasts

- Ensure steam vent is not blocked
- Descale water tank regularly

## Using MEATER+ Temperature Probe with Ninja Combi

The MEATER+ wireless temperature probe is fully compatible with the Ninja Combi oven and provides significant benefits for precise cooking:

### Benefits of Using MEATER+ with Ninja Combi

1. **Perfect Doneness Every Time**
   - Monitor internal temperature in real-time
   - Get notified when food reaches target temperature
   - No guesswork - especially useful for expensive cuts

2. **Multi-Phase Cooking Integration**
   - Monitor temperature through steam phase
   - Track temperature rise during air fry/roast phase
   - Ensure proteins are cooked through before crisping

3. **Home Assistant Integration**
   - View temperature on your phone/tablet
   - Get push notifications when food is ready
   - Track cooking history with temperature graphs
   - Automate indicator lights based on cooking progress

### How to Use MEATER+ in Ninja Combi

#### Probe Placement
- Insert probe into thickest part of meat (away from bone)
- Ensure probe tip is in center of food
- MEATER+ is wireless - no wires to route through door
- Safe to use in all Ninja Combi modes (steam, air fry, roast, combi)

#### Temperature Monitoring
- Open Home Assistant Kitchen Cooking Engine panel
- Select Ninja Combi recipe or set custom target
- Monitor real-time temperature during cooking
- Get notifications at key milestones

#### Best Recipes for MEATER+ Probe
The following Ninja Combi recipes benefit most from probe monitoring:
- **Combi-Crisp Chicken Thighs** (74°C / 165°F)
- **Combi-Roast Whole Chicken** (74°C / 165°F)
- **Combi-Roast Pork Loin** (63°C / 145°F)

- **Slow-Cooked Beef Stew** (93°C / 200°F for tender)
- **Slow-Cooked Pulled Pork** (93°C / 200°F for shreddable)

#### Tips for Probe Usage
- **Steam phase**: Probe works perfectly through steam
- **Air fry phase**: Monitor temperature rise as exterior crisps
- **Multiple pieces**: Place probe in thickest piece
- **Carryover cooking**: Remove food 2-3°C before target (especially for steaks/roasts)
- **Resting**: Keep probe in during rest to monitor temperature plateau

#### Combi Mode + Probe = Perfect Results
The combination of Ninja Combi's multi-phase cooking with MEATER+ probe monitoring is particularly powerful:

- **Combi-Crisp**: Steam to safe internal temp → Air fry for crispy exterior
  - Monitor temp during steam phase
  - Ensure target reached before crisping
  - No risk of overcooking interior while crisping

- **Combi-Roast**: Steam keeps meat moist → Roast for browning
  - Track even temperature rise during steam phase
  - Final roast phase develops color without drying
  - Perfect for large roasts and whole birds

### Example: Combi-Crisp Chicken with MEATER+

1. Insert MEATER+ probe into thickest part of chicken thigh
2. Start Combi-Crisp program (Steam 12 min → Air Fry 10 min)
3. During steam phase: Monitor temp rise from ~20°C to ~65°C
4. During air fry phase: Watch temp climb to 74°C while skin crisps
5. Get notification when 74°C reached (safe to eat)
6. Remove and rest 5 minutes (monitor temperature plateau)

**Result**: Perfectly cooked chicken (74°C internal) with crispy skin - no guesswork!

## Safety Notes

- Always use oven mitts (multiple trays get very hot)
- Allow steam to escape before opening door
- Don't open door during steam phase (interrupts cooking)
- Use oven-safe cookware only (no plastic)
- Keep clearance around oven vents

## Maintenance

- Empty drip tray after each use
- Clean water tank weekly
- Wipe interior after cooking
- Descale water tank monthly with vinegar solution
- Clean crisper tray in dishwasher
