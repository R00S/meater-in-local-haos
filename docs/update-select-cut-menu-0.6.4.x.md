# Branch Timeline: update-select-cut-menu (v0.6.4.x)

## Purpose

Fix the "Select Cut" step in the MEATER setup flow: it was rendered as a `<select>` HTML
dropdown instead of the button grid used by all other selector steps (Select Cut Type,
Doneness Level). The fix makes the UI consistent throughout.

## v0.6.5.0 — 2026-04-28

### CHORES

- Bumped version 0.6.4.9 → 0.6.5.0 (agent handoff increment: 4 → 5).
- Updated `USER_GUIDE.md`:
  - §5.8 Differences table: added **Language support** and **Measurement system** rows.
  - §5.8 Safety note: updated hardcoded `54°C (130°F)` example to unit-aware prose,
    noted that all temps follow the Measurement System setting.
  - §5.9: Added "Measurement system in recipes" callout box; added "Language support"
    subsection with table showing how Swedish names are provided per element (category,
    meat, cut_type, cut, doneness, UI labels, method descriptions).
  - §5.10 KCE:CUT example: added `name_sv:` at cut level and `name_sv:` per doneness entry.
  - §5.10 KCE:CUT fields table: documented `name_sv` as optional field.
  - §5.10 doneness entry docs: noted `name_sv:` option.
  - §5.10 KCE:CUT_METHOD example: added `description:` and `description_sv:` fields.
  - §12 Measurement settings: expanded paragraph to mention experimental path conversion.
- No help-button anchor changes needed (all existing anchors match current heading text).

## v0.6.4.9 — 2026-04-28

### Problem
Code review after v0.6.4.8 identified two issues:

1. The generator used the **first-seen cut's `name_sv`** as the Swedish name for the entire
   meat grouping (e.g. "Entrecôte" would become the Swedish name for "Cow") and for the
   cut_type grouping — incorrectly conflating cut names with group names.
2. The **classic `_renderSetupForm()` cut selector** (line ~3348) still used
   `cut.name_long || cut.name` without checking `name_sv`, making it inconsistent with the
   experimental path.

### Fixes
- Replaced propagation logic with two dedicated dicts in `generate_frontend_data.py`:
  - `_MEAT_NAME_SV` — 33 entries mapping meat IDs to correct Swedish names (e.g. `"cow" → "Nöt"`)
  - `_CUT_TYPE_NAME_SV` — 14 entries mapping cut_type display names (e.g. `"Steaks" → "Biffar"`)
- Classic cut selector now uses `(this._language === 'sv' && cut.name_sv) ? cut.name_sv : (cut.name_long || cut.name)`.
- Re-ran generator → PANEL_VERSION 335 → 336.

## v0.6.4.8 — 2026-04-28

### Problem
The experimental MEATER+ path did not respect the user's language or measurement-system
selection made on the front screen. All labels were hardcoded English, all temperatures
were hardcoded °C, and category/cut/doneness names had no Swedish equivalents.

### Fixes — four layers

**Layer 1 — UI strings**: All hardcoded English strings in `_renderMeaterExperimental()`,
`_renderExpSetupForm()`, and `_renderCutProfileCard()` replaced with `_t()` calls.
- Landing-page path buttons: `start_meater_cooking`, `start_meater_desc`, `recent_meater_cooks`, `recent_meater_desc`
- Status banner, session selector, category heading, meat/cut-type/cut step headings, doneness heading
- Safety legend, safety dot tooltips, safety warning block (culinary preferred / USDA minimum / risk text)
- Temperature fine-tune panel: heading, custom indicator, done/fine-tune toggles, reset label
- Cooking method panel: heading, method names via `cooking_methods.*` keys, recipe loading indicator
- Cut profile card: heading, method research label, close button, back-to-recipes button
- Start cooking button
- New i18n keys added to both `en.json` and `sv.json`:
  `safety_dot_safe`, `safety_dot_caution`, `safety_dot_unsafe`, `safety_legend`,
  `culinary_preferred`, `usda_safe_minimum`, `undercooked_risk`,
  `cut_profile`, `method_research`, `back_to_recipes`, `close_research`,
  `research_label`, `fine_tune_temp`, `reset_to`, `select_type`

**Layer 2 — Temperatures and measurements**: Every temperature display uses `_convertTemp()`.
- Doneness button temp hints
- Custom cook target temp display
- Fine-tuning: target temp display, safety warning values (culinary preferred + USDA safe minimum)
- Reset-to label in fine-tune panel
- Start cooking at temp label
- Recipe markdown content piped through `_convertIngredientText()` before `_mdToHtml()` in both
  the inline method panel and the cut profile research panel — so ingredient measurements and
  temperatures in recipe text automatically convert to the user's units

**Layer 3 — EXP_TREE Swedish names**: Infrastructure + data for `name_sv` in exp tree nodes.
- `_CATEGORY_META` extended with `name_sv` for all 7 categories
- Generator reads `name_sv` from KCE:CUT tag; propagates to cut objects, cut_type objects,
  and meat objects (first cut seen provides the name), and category objects
- `name_sv` added to KCE:CUT header blocks in 163 recipe research files
- JS display in category, meat, cut-type, cut buttons uses `name_sv` when `_language === 'sv'`
- `name_sv` also read from doneness entries in KCE:CUT doneness list

**Layer 4 — Swedish method descriptions**: Infrastructure for `description_sv` in method profiles.
- Generator reads `description_sv` field from KCE:CUT_METHOD YAML tag; stores it as
  `{method_slug}_sv` key in `CUT_METHOD_PROFILES` and `CLASSIC_CUT_METHOD_PROFILES`
- JS method description display uses `description_sv` when `_language === 'sv'`
- Data entry (adding `description_sv:` to individual method files) is incremental — any file
  without the field shows no Swedish description (falls back to English or nothing)

### Problems reported (screenshot)
The MEATER+ (experimental) setup form showed three bugs:
1. **"← Back to MEATER Path"** navigated to experimental landing page (confusing, as the landing page is never used — experimental always enters directly into setup form) and label implied classic MEATER path.
2. **Title** showed `🌡️ MEATER+ (bt_proxy_meater_tip_temperature)` — the raw appliance entity name, same format as classic path.
3. **Temperature Data Source card** was displayed even though the experimental path always uses International (USDA) and has no source choice.

### Fixes
- `_renderMeaterExperimental()` setup-form back button: changed action to `_navigateToWelcome()` and label to `this._t('nav.back_to_appliances')`.
- Title changed from `🌡️ ${appliance.name}` to `🧪🌡️ MEATER+ (experimental)` (static, matches welcome-screen card label).
- Removed the entire `<ha-card>` Temperature Data Source block from `_renderExpSetupForm()`.
- Re-ran generator → PANEL_VERSION 332 → 333.
- Bumped version 0.6.4.6 → 0.6.4.7.

## v0.6.4.6 — 2026-04-28

### Problem discovered
The **Select Cut** card used a `<select>` dropdown element while every other selector step
(Select Meat, Select Cut Type, Doneness Level) used a row of `<button>` elements.
This was visible in both the standard MEATER path and the MEATER+ (experimental) path.

### Root cause
In `panel-class-template.js` both render paths (`_renderSetupForm` around line 3343 and the
experimental render path around line 4592) contained a `<select>/<option>` block for the cut
step, while all other steps used `<div class="button-group">` with `<button class="category-btn">`.

### Fix applied
- Replaced both `<select>` blocks in `www/panel-class-template.js` with `<div class="button-group">` +
  `<button class="category-btn">` pattern (matching the cut-type selector).
- Re-ran `python3 generate_frontend_data.py` → PANEL_VERSION bumped 331 → 332.
- Bumped integration version 0.6.4.5 → 0.6.4.6.
- Updated USER_GUIDE.md to reflect that Select Cut now uses buttons.
