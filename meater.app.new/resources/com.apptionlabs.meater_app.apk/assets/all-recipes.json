      "text": "Feast your eyes on the King of Steaks! This is a favorite cut among barbeque enthusiasts for its affordability and gorgeous marbling, so you've probably had a few at cookouts, but we're guessing you've never tried one like this. Low and slow cooking keeps your steak tender and juicy, and doesn't dry out the meat as much as a high heat cook. Hitting the steak with a quick reverse sear at the end is going to give you a crust on the outside to rival any expensive steakhouse.\n\nThis might sound intimidating, but don't sweat it! MEATER is here to walk you through cooking the perfect steak, and our Guided Cook system will help you get consistent results every single time.\n\nWhen it comes to side dishes for rib-eye, we like to keep it simple with roasted vegetables or a good ol' beef and potatoes meal. You can also find a variety of drool-worthy sauces in our recipe menu if you want to jazz up your rib-eye. If you're looking for a classy beverage, you'll want something that can stand up to the meaty flavor of rib-eye, like a full-bodied red wine or a stout."

Cooking your rib-eye low and slow with MEATER will perfectly render that beautiful marbling, and then the biting taste of the horseradish will perfectly balance out the steak's fatty mouthfeel. And you know you can trust us because we just used the word \"mouthfeel.\"\n\nWhen it comes to side dishes for rib-eye, we like to keep it simple with roasted vegetables or a good ol' beef and potatoes meal. If you're looking for a classy beverage, you'll want something that can stand up to the meaty flavor of rib-eye, like cabernet sauvignon or stout."

If not, please allow us to blow your minds. When you take a tender rib-eye cooked low and slow with MEATER, then give it a reverse sear and top it with a pat of our garlic and herb butter, the result is a juicy and buttery delight that just might make you wonder why you ever eat anything else.\n\nWhen it comes to side dishes for rib-eye, we like to keep it simple with roasted vegetables or a good ol' beef and potatoes meal. If you're looking for a classy beverage, you'll want something that can stand up to the meaty flavor of rib-eye, like cabernet sauvignon or stout."

      "text": "How do you choose between cooking a nice meal or cooking an easy one? The answer is: You don't! Just make this recipe! It's easy to make, but looks and tastes like fine dining. The sun dried tomatoes and fresh thyme combine perfectly for a classic Italian flavor, the thin layer of mustard adds unique tanginess, and the quick sear before baking brings color and crunch to the chicken. Plus, chicken breast is one of the healthier proteins, so you can feel great about what you're eating without being annoyed at the lack of taste.\n\nThe downside of chicken breast's low fat content is that it can end up dry pretty easily, so using a meat thermometer is the key to avoiding that. But not just any meat thermometer! Not only will MEATER let you know when to take your chicken out of the oven to hit the perfect temperature, but the MEATER app will also give you doneness recommendations based on what's going to give you the juiciest result.\n\nSince you've already got some carbs in your main dish, our recommendation is to go with veggies for your side, like a Caesar salad with crisp lettuce. Chicken breast is a super lean protein, so you can also lean into the healthiness and steam some vegetables. A nice glass of wine will look gorgeous next to your beautiful breaded chicken, so reach for something dry like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay. You can also keep it a bit more casual with a citrusy beer like IPA."

      "text": "Brace yourselves, it's about to get hot in here. This is a traditional Portuguese recipe with an exotic blend of flavors that hit nearly every flavor palate. It's usually made with peri peri peppers (or African bird's eye chilis), but we swapped them out for habanero peppers since they've got more heat with a little sweet. Fair warning, though: Habanero peppers fall between 100,000 and 350,000 on the Scoville scale, which is basically a fancy way of saying that you should maybe have some milk nearby to stop the burning.\n\nThere are two main tricks to getting a perfectly juicy bird with crispy skin. The first is spatchcocking the chicken so it cooks more evenly (which we'll cover in the recipe, so don't worry if you have no clue what that means). The second is starting with higher heat and reducing it partway through, which is where the MEATER app's custom alerts come in handy.\n\nBecause this chicken is made with spicy habanero peppers, it works best with milder side dishes like white rice or a fresh green salad. Or if you like the feeling of your mouth being on fire, you can just get some fresh vegetables and drown them in your extra peri peri sauce, you daredevil, you. Bitter beverages are known for making spicy sensations worse, so you can grab one of those if you're into that sort of thing, or you can find more relief with something with more sugar content. Fruity red wines like pinot noir or dark and sweet ales are your best bet."

      "text": "Brace yourselves, it's about to get hot in here. This is a traditional Portuguese recipe with an exotic blend of flavors that hit nearly every flavor palate. It's usually made with peri peri peppers (or African bird's eye chilis), but we swapped them out for habanero peppers since they've got more heat with a little sweet. Fair warning, though: Habanero peppers fall between 100,000 and 350,000 on the Scoville scale, which is basically a fancy way of saying that you should maybe have some milk nearby to stop the burning.\n\nThere are two main tricks to getting a perfectly juicy bird with crispy skin. The first is spatchcocking the chicken so it cooks more evenly (which we'll cover in the recipe, so don't worry if you have no clue what that means). The second is starting with higher heat and reducing it partway through, which is where the MEATER app's custom alerts come in handy.\n\nBecause this chicken is made with spicy habanero peppers, it works best with milder side dishes like white rice or a fresh green salad. Or if you like the feeling of your mouth being on fire, you can just get some fresh vegetables and drown them in your extra peri peri sauce, you daredevil, you."

It's a perfect balance, not easy enough to be called lazy, but not difficult enough to be panic-inducing. It's a family classic and an international staple, and it's highly customizable to your flavor preference. And the cherry on top of this cluckin' cake is that it's up there with the healthier proteins, so you can feel indulgent and responsible at the same time.\n\nThe perfect chicken is tender and moist on the inside with a nice crisp to the skin, and the best way to do this is to start the cook at a lower temperature, then crank it up later in the cook. One of the many beauties of MEATER is the app's custom alerts, which let you set a notification for when it's time to turn up the heat.\n\nWe just know you want your plate looking like a page straight out of a 1950's cookbook, so build yourself a platter with a roasted vegetable medley and some mashed potatoes. If you're taking it a step further and busting out the fancy glassware, fill it up with a dry white wine like chardonnay, or a milder beer like a lager."

      "text": "Until a few years ago, these beefy beauties weren't well known outside of a few spots in Texas, which is just a darned shame. But luckily for everyone outside of Texas, they've started to take the barbecue world by storm. If you need a bit of convincing why you ought to give these a try, they're sometimes nicknamed \"brisket on the bone\" for their tender, fall-apart texture. Even though you can use any rub you like, the're traditionally made with simple seasonings to allow their natural flavor to shine through.\n\nJust like brisket and other smoked meats, these ribs should be wrapped partway through the cook to preserve some of those tasty juices and to help you get through the infamous stall. Instead of having to constantly watch for that slowdown, wouldn't you rather go about your day and just get a heads up when it's a good time to wrap? Well hey, that's where the MEATER app's custom alerts come in!\n\nThe basic salt and pepper seasoning makes these ribs pretty versatile, and you can use any of your favorite barbecue staples on the side. If you'd like our two cents, you can balance out your beef with a lighter dish like salad, or some kind of carb like Texas toast or garlic bread (or garlic Texas toast!). Nothing beats a cold beer at a barbecue, and we recommend an IPA to cut through the fat of the beef ribs, or a stout to enhance the rich and smoky flavor of the meat."

Take your time and be careful when you're trimming the fat so you're not accidentally hacking off pieces of the meat as well. The silverskin under the bone should stay on so the ribs won't just fall apart. Or at least not until you want them to."

The process of smoking a brisket is pretty simple, but if you really want that melt-in-your-mouth beef (and trust us, you do), the key is to take your time and not rush it. Slow-smoked brisket is rich and full of flavor all by itself, so we like staying true to the classic Texas style of simple salt and pepper seasoning.\n\nIf you've never smoked a brisket before, brace yourself, because that bad boy is going to be cooking for a long while. If you're an early riser, you can get up with the sun, smoke all day, and have a brisket dinner. As an alternative, we like to smoke it overnight, then give it a long rest so it's ready just in time for lunch. If you've never done an overnight smoke, we understand that it might sound a bit scary. But don't you worry, because MEATER will keep you updated at key moments in your cook so you don't have to stand out by the smoker in your bathrobe all night long!\n\nBrisket is filling enough that you might not even need to make a side dish. If you're feeling ambitious, balance out your beef with a lighter dish like salad, or some kind of carb like Texas toast or garlic bread (or garlic Texas toast!). Nothing beats a cold beer at a barbecue, and we recommend an IPA to cut through the fat of the brisket, or a stout to enhance the rich and smoky flavor of the meat."

This creamy sauce (or crÃ¨me, if you will) gets its biting flavor from the combination of spicy horseradish and tangy lemon juice which not only makes it a tasty treat, but also effectively clears your sinuses. So you might say our horseradish crÃ¨me recipe is, quite literally, a breath of fresh air.\n\nThis is a perfect partner for steak, though you can also add it to ribs, fish, chicken, or pretty much anything that you're cooking with MEATER. If you have a particular steak cut in mind, our recipe menu has some combined recipes which will make preparing the steak and sauce a breeze. It's also an exciting topper for roasted vegetables (broccoli and cauliflower in particular) or baked potatoes. "

It's hard to imagine how to make a great rib-eye better than it already is...but there is one way. The tomahawk steak takes all of the incredible taste and texture of rib-eye, then adds several inches of bone to make it one of the most impressive looking pieces of meat out there. This bone also serves as a built-in handle, eliminating the need for tongs, and making any average griller look super hardcore. For this reason, it's not surprising that the tomahawk has recently risen in popularity. Whether you're planning to show off at your neighborhood BBQ or you're doing it for the 'Gram, you want your steak looking the best it can be, so you'll want to rely on your MEATER to give you the juiciest and most beautiful result!"

Heck, you can even plan entire cheese-based vacations. Soft cheeses especially are used in high-end appetizers and accompaniments, and you'll find blue cheese sauce on the menu at most steakhouses. Since we're all about creating a steakhouse experience at home, it's only natural that we'd have our own blue cheese sauce recipe. Ours uses gorgonzola dolce for a milder, creamier flavor, and you can make it in less than half an hour with not a lot of ingredients.\n\nThis creamy, cheesy party in your mouth goes best with lean cuts of beef. To amp up your backyard barbecues, whip up some burgers with lean ground beef and use this sauce as a topper. If you're in the mood for more of a treat, you can jump back to our recipe menu to find out how to make this sauce with a reverse seared filet mignon."

      "text": "We're not here to smack talk a nice button mushroom or anything that like that, but if you really want that swanky steakhouse feel, you need to kick your mushroom sauce up a notch. Gourmet chefs love porcini mushrooms for their meaty and nutty taste, which is deeper than most mushrooms you'll find at the grocery store. It's a flavor that pairs beautifully with any cut of beef, so we wanted to turn it into a creamy sauce that you can serve with your MEATER creations. Our recipe uses red wine and rosemary to blend with the earthiness of the mushrooms, giving you a delicious autumnal dish at any time of year. See? We're fancy.\n\nNo matter what kind of steak you like best, adding this mushroom sauce will take it from amazing to amazing-er. If you're not sure which cut you want and you need a little guidance, it works especially well with leaner cuts. In fact, our recipe menu has a couple of combined recipes to help you cook this sauce with either sirloin steak or tenderloin filet. In the very likely scenario that you just can't get enough of this sauce, it can also be an elevated topper for pasta or mashed potatoes."

Though it has a high-end price tag to match, you only need one bite of this luxurious cut to know it's worth it. To those who haven't yet tried filet mignon, the idea of beef melting in your mouth might seem like colorful exaggeration, but let us assure you that the description is accurate.\n\nWith a lavish cut like tenderloin, you'll want to take extra care to make sure it's cooked correctly and won't end up an expensive disappointment. To fully experience the buttery tenderness that makes this piece of meat so special, cook low and slow with MEATER as your guide, and then hit it with a quick reverse sear to get a hint of crunch on the outside for a beautiful texture contrast!\n\nPotatoes and roasted vegetables are always a good choice to pair with a classy steak. If you'd like to elevate your tenderloin even further, you can return to the recipe menu to check out our library of amazing sauces, as well as our combined tenderloin and sauce recipes to make your life even easier."

This recipe lets you live your dreams of a holiday feast at any time of year. Or you can save it for the actual season and just blow everyone's minds with the best turkey they've ever eaten.\n\nIf there's one fear every chef has in common around the holidays, it's serving up a dry bird. You can put that to rest, because MEATER will notify you when your turkey is ready, so you can sit back and relax without having to keep checking the oven. (Or you can keep pretending to check in case you need a break from your family.)\n\nA classic holiday table includes a veritable buffet of hot side dishes, like roasted vegetables, potatoes, and gravy. You can stick to the classics or get creative with your own, as long as your guests leave with a full stomach and plenty of leftovers. If the food doesn't make you sleepy enough, just add a glass of white wine, or sparkling wine if you really feel like getting into the holiday spirit."

But do you want to know a secret? It doesn't actually make that much of a difference. As it turns out, tying the legs together is an aesthetic choice and is totally up to your preference. We like it because it's traditional, and it looks way more elegant than letting the turkey just stick its legs out however it feels in the moment. If you have kitchen twine handy, you can truss your turkey the old-fashioned way, but using the skin saves you a little bit of waste."

      "text": "There's nothing like a piping hot pile of pulled pork at a party, so it can be a struggle when it's too cold outside or when you live somewhere without access to a smoker. That's why we're here to heal your broken heart, and let you know that there's a way to make juicy, succulent pulled pork using your oven. It's a cinch to pull off, and it feeds a ton of people so you can be the most popular person at your next indoor luau.\n\nEven though pulled pork is hard to mess up, it's still important to cook it properly so that the meat doesn't dry out. Not only will MEATER let you know when your pork is at its juiciest and most shreddable, but you can also set custom alerts to remind you to wrap it, which means you can focus all of your attention on party prep.\n\nPulled pork can be served with any of your favorite barbecue sides, so have fun creating your own personalized barbecue platter. Personally, we like fresh coleslaw to offset the heaviness of the pork. When it comes to drinks, there's nothing like cracking open a cold beer at a barbecue."

Just make sure you're using classic yellow mustard, because spicy, creamy, or ground varieties can easily mess with the taste and texture of your pork."

Personally, we like fresh parsley and chives for color and flavor, and just a touch of lemon juice to add a little something extra.\n\nThis butter makes a decadent, flavorful topper for just about any cut of steak, and we've added a few combined recipes in our recipe menu if you want to cook your favorite cut of steak and your garlic butter at the same time. You'll also get a ton of servings with this recipe, so if you run out of steak, go ahead and throw a healthy dollop on your seafood or vegetables. Or just buy more steak."

      "text": "Who says you have to drop a fortune to eat well? Even inexpensive cuts like this one can be beautifully tender and flavorful when they're done right. Sirloin has a characteristic fat layer along one side, and when you do a slow cook followed by a quick reverse sear with the fat side first, that layer keeps the steak juicy and creates a veritable flavor explosion in the meat while it cooks. Plus, more affordable steaks like this one are pretty easy to find in most grocery stores, so you won't be going on a whole expedition just to find something to cook for dinner.\n\nThe trick to a gourmet sirloin is taking your time. Since it doesn't have as much marbling as rib-eye, it can dry out if it's overcooked. Low and slow cooking is the best way to avoid this, along with using MEATER to make sure you're hitting the perfect internal temperature.\n\nWhen it comes to side dishes for sirloin, we like to keep it simple with roasted vegetables or a good ol' beef and potatoes meal. You can also find a variety of mouth-watering sauces in our recipe menu if you want to add some flair to your sirloin. If you're looking for a perfect beverage pairing, you'll find the best balance with something acidic, like a fruity and full-bodied red wine like cabernet sauvignon, or a citrusy IPA."

It's usually made with peri peri peppers (or African bird's eye chilis), but we swapped them out for habanero peppers since they've got more heat with a little sweet. Fair warning, though: Habanero peppers fall between 100,000 and 350,000 on the Scoville scale, which is basically a fancy way of saying that you should maybe have some milk nearby to stop the burning.\n\nThis sauce is perfect for dipping, so serve it up with chicken wings or snacky vegetables the next time you have people over. It also makes an amazing marinade for chicken or fish if you're looking to spice up your dinnertime."

This recipe has everything: high-end beef, garlic, butter, a smidgen of fresh produce in there for good measure...and that's pretty much all of your food groups. And we haven't even gotten to the flavor yet. Filet mignon cooked low and slow with MEATER and reverse seared is already a tasty treat, but slapping on some of our garlic butter makes for one of the most decadent, melt-in-your-mouth indulgences you'll ever have.\n\nA classy cut of beef like this one deserves side dishes that are just as sophisticated. SautÃ©ed vegetables will add color to your plate, and you can do your own elevated take on beef and potatoes with some cheesy scalloped potatoes. You won't want a wine that might overpower the more subtle flavor of the beef, so milder reds like pinot noir are a good idea."

      "text": "This is the perfect recipe for those times when you feel like a classic salt-and-pepper filet mignon just isn't fancy enough. Just kidding, no one has ever thought that. But still, if you're feeling ambitious on a special occasion and really want to knock your filet mignon into the statosphere, you need a sauce that's worthy of such a high-end cut of beef. Porcini mushrooms are considered a luxury ingredient, not just because they're tricky to find and cultivate, but also because of their deep and autumnal flavor that makes them so unique. Cooking them up in this creamy blend will give you a truly magical mushroom sauce to elevate your filet mignon. No, not that kind of magic mushroom sauce. It just tastes crazy good.\n\nA classy cut of beef like this one deserves side dishes that are just as sophisticated. SautÃ©ed vegetables will add color to your plate, and you can do your own elevated take on beef and potatoes with a garlic and herb mash or some cheesy scalloped potatoes. You won't want a wine that might overpower the more subtle flavor of the beef, so milder reds like pinot noir are a good idea."

      "text": "From homey burger joints to high-end steakhouses, you'll find beef and blue cheese combos all over the place. The sharpness and texture of the cheese provide a beautiful contrast to the deep beefy flavor without detracting from the meat, so it's pretty easy to suss out why the two are such an inseparable pair. The only downside (and we mean the ONLY downside) is that a quality steak topped with blue cheese doesn't usually come cheap, so we did the only reasonable thing, which was to come up with a recipe to make it at home. We picked gorgonzola for this recipe both for its unique creaminess, and because it's among the mildest of the blue cheeses. A juicy filet mignon cooked to perfection with MEATER and topped with our gorgonzola sauce is so decadent, you might just have to start wearing a top hat and monocle everywhere you go.\n\nA classy cut of beef like this one deserves side dishes that are just as sophisticated. SautÃ©ed vegetables will add color to your plate, and you can do your own elevated take on beef and potatoes with a garlic and herb mash. You won't want a wine that might overpower the more subtle flavor of the beef, so milder reds like pinot noir are a good idea."

Porcini mushrooms have a distinctly deep and meaty taste that makes them a natural counterpart for beef. And then there's sirloin steak which, when cooked low and slow and then hit with a reverse sear, also becomes insanely flavorful. Together, they're like a match made in Meat Heaven.\n\nWhen it comes to side dishes for sirloin, we like to keep it simple with roasted vegetables or a good ol' beef and potatoes meal. If you're looking for a perfect beverage pairing, you'll find the best balance with something acidic, like a fruity and full-bodied red wine like cabernet sauvignon, or a citrusy IPA."

Everyone loves a good pulled meat sandwich, but what happens when they need a break from pulled pork or chicken, and are clamoring for something different? Lamb shoulder is insanely juicy and delicious when smoked slowly, and it can be shredded just like a classic pork shoulder. In true Texas style, our recipe uses a simple salt and pepper seasoning so you can let the taste of the meat speak for itself.\n\nWe won't lie to you, lamb is going to be more expensive than other pulled meats. That's why it's extra important to have the right tools to make sure you'll end up with tender meat and a perfect crust. What are the \"right tools\"? We're so glad you asked! MEATER will keep you updated with the internal temperature, and can even give you a heads up when to wrap, so you can pull off a pulled lamb that will blow everyone away.\n\nIf you're dropping the money on a nice lamb shoulder, chances are you're doing it because you like the flavor, which means you don't want to distract from it with overwhelming sides or sauces. We recommend serving it on Texas toast with a simple side of fresh vegetables or coleslaw. Cold beer is a classic at a barbecue, and a citrusy beer like an IPA will be best for balancing out the flavor of the lamb."

It keeps well at warm temperatures and feeds a lot of people, so it's perfect for big get-togethers. Plus, if you pick up some rolls, you can put together little sandwiches and make everyone think this was way more planned out.\n\nEven though pulled pork is hard to mess up, it's still important to cook it properly so that the meat doesn't dry out. Not only will MEATER let you know when your pork is at its juiciest and most shreddable, but you can also set custom alerts to remind you to wrap it, which means you can focus all of your attention on party prep.\n\nPulled pork can be served with any of your favorite barbecue sides, so have fun creating your own personalized barbecue platter. Personally, we like fresh coleslaw to offset the heaviness of the pork, and cornbread to go with the sweetness of the apple flavors. When it comes to drinks, there's nothing like cracking open a cold beer at a barbecue, and bitter varieties like IPA will balance out the sweet taste of the pork."

Our unique contribution is celery salt, which works with the garlic and onion powders to give the pork a slightly fresh taste so you can feel good about eating your vegetables while loading up on starchy side dishes. Since pork doesn't absorb as much smoke as as other proteins like beef, we also cheated a little bit and opted for smoked paprika."

      "text": "To many people, the word \"meatloaf\" immediately conjures memories of a home-cooked meal prepared by the loving hands of a mother, grandmother, or other maternal figure. While a well-crafted meatloaf evokes feelings of warmth and familiarity, it seems uncommon to find those same feelings when ordering meatloaf at a restaurant. To truly capture the magic of a meatloaf, it's best made in the home. Luckily, that's very easy to do.\n\nEven though meatloaf (or some version of it) has endured for centuries in different parts of the world, it has traditionally been most popular during times of hardship as a way to stretch protein and make the most of leftovers. For this reason, meatloaf is extremely versatile, and can be made with any meats and flavorings the chef desires. The only undisputed rule is that it must be cooked to perfection to produce a soft and succulent result, so it's a good thing you've got MEATER on your side!\n\nA classic, homey dish like this one deserves comforting sides to match, so we suggest serving it alongside some creamy mashed potatoes, and some cooked vegetables like green beans or asparagus."

If this is you, we've got a couple of things that might ease your mind. First, as long as you're cooking low and slow with MEATER, the distinctive fat layer on the side will melt into the meat and inject it with bigtime beefy flavor. Second, if the melty fat doesn't convince you, you'll get to finish this recipe by plopping on some garlic butter on there and basically counteracting the leanness of the meat. On top of being a blend of garlic and butter, which is already a major selling point, we've also thrown in some of our favorite herbs and a little squeeze of lemon juice for our own special flair.\n\nWhen it comes to side dishes for sirloin, we like to keep it simple with roasted vegetables or a good ol' beef and potatoes meal. You can also find a variety of mouth-watering sauces in our recipe menu if you want to add some flair to your sirloin. If you're looking for a perfect beverage pairing, you'll find the best balance with something acidic, like a fruity and full-bodied cabernet sauvignon or Bordeaux, or a citrusy IPA."

Along with being a powerhouse of health benefits, salmon is super quick and easy to cook. It's tasty on its own or with a squeeze of lemon, but our recipe will make it sweet and smoky with just the teensiest bit of a kick. Either way, you get to pat yourself on the back for making such good choices. We're proud of you.\n\nEven low and slow smoking doesn't take very long with salmon, so it can be easy to overcook and dry out. Lucky for you, you've got MEATER to tell you when your fish is at its peak flaky deliciousness.\n\nSo you've got yourself a healthy protein, why not go all out and fix yourself a whole nutritious meal? Brown rice and fresh greens are easy side dishes, and will make you feel better about indulging with an elegant beverage. Speaking of which, salmon is usually coupled with white wine, specifically sweet or sparkling whites if the salmon is smoked."

Pork chops are quick to cook, and this recipe uses a basic seasoning blend gets your pork from the fridge to the oven to your plate in no time without sacrificing the flavor. And they're inexpensive to boot!\n\nSince pork is at its crackliest when you cook it at a high temperature, you'll want to make sure it doesn't dry out. That's why it's especially handy to use MEATER to alert you at the perfect internal temperature, and keep you from losing any delectable juiciness.\n\nPork chops go well with classic mashed potatoes, or sweeter sides like applesauce. Refreshing beverages are the best option so you don't overpower your pork, so reach for a crisp cider or pinot noir."

      "text": " The biggest complaint when smoking pork ribs or more specifically St. Louis-style pork spare ribs most people have is that they turn out dry and tough. The 3-2-1 method, so named for the three sets of cooking time ,for smoking ribs nearly guarantees tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs without a lot of extra effort. St. Louis-style ribs are cut from close to the belly of the pig, and have the tips removed. This makes for a very clean rectangular shape that cooks evenly. St. Louis-style spare ribs are usually ready for a rub and to head to the smoker as soon as you bring them home. The smell of that smoked meat and the taste dispelled by that spice mix will spread all over the place and make your neighbors jump off the fence [to taste]!"

Or maybe you're hosting a party for people who both love barbecue and own yachts, and you need to cook something impressive. In either case, smoked duck breast should meet your needs pretty nicely.\n\nOf course you never want to mess up when cooking your food, but it's especially important to get it right when you're cooking something fancy like duck. When it's overcooked, duck meat can end up really tough. But properly-cooked duck will be tender on the inside with gorgeous, deep red skin and crispy fat, and MEATER will help you calculate the perfect cook time to make that happen!\n\nIf you're going to indulge with your main course, why not do the same with your sides? Duck breast should be paired with a decadent French side dish, particularly something cheesy like potatoes au gratin."

At the end of a long day, the last thing you want to do is whip up something complicated for dinner, but you also don't want to get tired of the same quick recipes you're cooking every single night. Our lemon chicken recipe is simple to cook with ingredients you may already have at home, and it's anything but boring. As an added bonus, it's low in calories, so you can feel great while still enjoying what you eat.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns when cooking chicken breast is that it might turn out dry. The fact that we bake the chicken in lemon butter for this recipe certainly helps, but the real secret is using MEATER to make sure your chicken is cooked to the perfect temperature!\n\nWhile you can have a crisp salad as a side if you want to be super healthy, we encourage serving your chicken with a starch, like potatoes or rice, to fill out the meal. As an added bonus, these kinds of sides will soak up your extra sauce so you won't waste a drop of that lemony, buttery goodness."

Salmon is well known for being healthy, and is typically found on the menu at pretty classy establishments, so no way it's also easy to cook. Well, as it turns out, yes way. You don't need any special equipment, just an oven and your favorite catch. You don't even need a lot of seasoning to make a scrumptious salmon meal, but throwing on a few fresh herbs will take your fish from great to extra great.\n\nOn top of being simple and healthy, salmon also doesn't take much time to cook. Because of this, there's a risk of overcooking, but luckily you've got MEATER by your side to keep that from happening!\n\nIn keeping with the easy and healthy theme, we like to serve our oven baked salmon with steamed vegetables or white rice."

At the end of a long day, the last thing you want to do is whip up something complicated for dinner, but you also don't want to get tired of the same quick recipes you're cooking every single night. Our lemon chicken recipe is simple to cook with ingredients you may already have at home, and it's anything but boring. As an added bonus, it's low in calories, so you can feel great while still enjoying what you eat.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns when cooking chicken breast is that it might turn out dry. The fact that we bake the chicken in lemon butter for this recipe certainly helps, but the real secret is using MEATER to make sure your chicken is cooked to the perfect temperature!\n\nWhile you can have a crisp salad as a side if you want to be super healthy, we encourage serving your chicken with a starch, like potatoes or rice, to fill out the meal. As an added bonus, these kinds of sides will soak up your extra sauce so you won't waste a drop of that lemony, buttery goodness."

Or maybe you're hosting a party for people who both love barbecue and own yachts, and you need to cook something impressive. In either case, smoked duck breast should meet your needs pretty nicely.\n\nOf course you never want to mess up when cooking your food, but it's especially important to get it right when you're cooking something fancy like duck. When it's overcooked, duck meat can end up really tough. But properly-cooked duck will be tender on the inside with gorgeous, deep red skin and crispy fat, and MEATER will help you calculate the perfect cook time to make that happen!\n\nIf you're going to indulge with your main course, why not do the same with your sides? Duck breast should be paired with a decadent French side dish, particularly something cheesy like potatoes au gratin."

      "text": "This is a beef dish that's loved universally, and can be enjoyed for pretty much any meal. Hearty dinners! Sunday roasts! Sandwich lunches! Breakfast, probably! Leaner roasts are more prone to drying out, but there are some ways to prevent that. First, if you can, try to find a roast with a good bit of marbling while you're shopping. Second, take your time and cook that baby low and slow.\n\nOf course, hitting the perfect internal temperature is also key in achieving perfectly tender roast beef, so MEATER is your best friend for telling you when to remove that roast from the oven.\n\nThere are so many ways to enjoy a beef roast. For a casual meal, we love our big beef and cheddar sandwiches. If we're feeling ambitious, we'll go all out with potatoes, vegetables, and Yorkshire puddings for a proper Sunday carvery. With roast beef, you really can't go wrong with any red wine, but we recommend something a little more dry like cabernet sauvignon."

      "text": "This bird is on FIRE. First, we made our own unique spin on Portuguese peri peri chicken, and shared our insanely tasty oven roasted recipe with the world. Now, we've one-upped ourselves by taking our spicy, tangy, lightly sweet chicken and chucking it on the grill for even more of a flavor explosion.\n\nThere are a few main tricks to getting a perfectly juicy bird with crispy skin. The first is spatchcocking the chicken so it cooks more evenly (which we'll cover in the recipe, so don't worry if you have no clue what that means). The second is starting with higher heat and reducing it partway through. And the third, of course, is your good friend MEATER letting you know when that fiery motherclucker is at the perfect internal temperature.\n\nBecause this chicken is made with spicy habanero peppers, it works best with milder side dishes like white rice or a fresh green salad. Or if you like the feeling of your mouth being on fire, you can just get some fresh vegetables and drown them in your extra peri peri sauce, you daredevil, you. Bitter beverages are known for making spicy sensations worse, so you can grab one of those if you're into that sort of thing, or you can find more relief with something with more sugar content. Fruity red wines like pinot noir or dark and sweet ales are your best bet."

      "text": "You're probably used to thinking of pork as more of a casual protein, reserved for breakfasts, barbecues, and busy nights where you don't have a lot of time to cook. But who knew eating pork could be more of a luxury experience? Well, we did. And now you do too! True to its name, the tenderloin is the most tender and juicy cut of pork, but it doesn't carry quite as high a price tag as its beefy counterpart.\n\nThe key to perfect pork tenderloin is taking your time. Since it doesn't have as much fat as other cuts of pork, it can dry out if it's overcooked. Low and slow cooking is the best way to avoid this, along with using MEATER to make sure you're hitting the perfect internal temperature. Once that's done, just give it a sear so you'll still end up with a gorgeous golden brown crust.\n\nSince this is a bit more of a high-end cut of pork, we recommend stepping it up from the usual veggies. Maybe opt for sautÃ©ed mushrooms or risotto. Or mushroom risotto! Refreshing beverages are the best option so you don't overpower your pork, so reach for a crisp cider or pinot noir."

But don't worry, because it doesn't carry quite as high a price tag as its beefy counterpart.\n\nThe key to perfect pork tenderloin is taking your time. Since it doesn't have as much fat as other cuts of pork, it can dry out if it's overcooked. Low and slow cooking is the best way to avoid this, along with using MEATER to make sure you're hitting the perfect internal temperature. Once that's done, just give it a sear so you'll still end up with a gorgeous golden brown crust.\n\nSince this is a bit more of a high-end cut of pork, we recommend stepping it up from the usual veggies, and swapping out the regular potatoes for sweet potatoes. Refreshing beverages are the best option so you don't overpower your pork, so reach for a crisp cider or pinot noir."

It doesn't matter if you catch it fresh and grill it right at your campsite, or if you just wear a fishing vest to the grocery store and set up a tent in your backyard. Either way, you can feel good about the fact that you're serving up a protein packed with all sorts of tasty vitamins and minerals. For this recipe, we use ingredients that are commonly found in salmon recipes, but hey, it's a classic for a reason.\n\nSalmon fillet tends to cook pretty quickly, which means you want to make sure you're on top of your temperature readings so it doesn't dry out. But you also don't want to be standing by your grill while you're trying to be one with nature, and that's why you've got MEATER to let you know when the salmon is all ready to go.\n\nSo you've got yourself a healthy protein, why not go all out and fix yourself a whole nutritious meal? Since you've already got the grill fired up, you might as well toss some veggies on there, and asparagus is our green of choice for grilled salmon. This nutritious spread will make you feel better about indulging in an elegant beverage, and sweeter white wines like sauvignon blanc or riesling are perfect for rounding out this meal."

      "text": "If you haven't already joined the peri peri party, what the heck are you waiting for? This spicy and flavorful chicken is taking the world by storm, so naturally we wanted to jump on the train and create our own recipe. We swapped out the traditional peri peri peppers for habanero peppers to add a little sweetness to the spicy, tangy sauce, and then we threw it on a charcoal grill to add a final flavor of fire into the mix. We know you're not afraid of the fire. You live in it. You thrive in it.\n\nThe goal here is a perfectly juicy bird with crispy skin, so this recipe calls for spatchcocking the chicken so it cooks more evenly (which we'll cover in the recipe, so don't worry if you have no clue what that means). We also make good use of MEATER's handy custom alerts to let you know when to flip your chicken, and to keep you posted on your ambient temperature in case you need to add coals or adjust the vents.\n\nBecause this chicken is made with spicy habanero peppers, it works best with milder side dishes like white rice or a fresh green salad. Or if you like the feeling of your mouth being on fire, you can just get some fresh vegetables and drown them in your extra peri peri sauce, you daredevil, you. Bitter beverages are known for making spicy sensations worse, so you can grab one of those if you're into that sort of thing, or you can find more relief with something with more sugar content. Fruity red wines like pinot noir or dark and sweet ales are your best bet."
