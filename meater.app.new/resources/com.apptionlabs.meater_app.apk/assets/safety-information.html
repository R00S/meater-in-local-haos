<li>Use MEATER only for its intended purpose.</li>
<li>MEATER is designed for use in meat (food).</li>
<li>To protect against the risk of electric shock, do not immerse the charging block in water or other liquids.</li>
<li>To avoid damage to MEATER, insertion of the probe in the meat past the Safety Notch is necessary.</li>
<li>DO NOT use MEATER probes in microwaves.</li>
<li>DO NOT drop MEATER on a hard surface.</li>
<li>MEATER probes are not dishwasher safe. Please hand wash with soap and water before and after each use.</li>
<li>MEATER is water resistant, not waterproof. Do not submerge in water for long periods of time.</li>
<li>Please take caution with the pointed tip of the probe.</li>
<li>Probe will be very hot during or just after a cook. DO NOT touch with bare hands.</li>
<li>DO NOT submerge the MEATER probe in cold water after cooking. Wait until it has cooled down prior to washing.</li>
<li>MEATER is not a toy. Close supervision is necessary if MEATER is to be used near children.</li>
<li>Make sure the MEATER probes are completely dry when placed back in the charger or MEATER Block.</li>
<li>The internal sensor max is 212°F (100°C). Temps above the maximum may potentially damage MEATER.</li>
<li>The ambient sensor max is 527°F (275°C). Temps above the maximum may potentially damage MEATER.</li>
<li>When cooking, ensure the ambient sensor or any part of the probe is not touching any HOT cooking surface.</li>
<li>Avoid applying left/right/up/down pressure on the MEATER ceramic handle when removing from the meat. To remove, pull and twist on the same horizontal axis of insertion.</li>
<li>Consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, or seafood may increase your risk of foodborne illness. To reduce the risk, cook your food to USDA safe temperatures.</li>
<li>When not in use, store MEATER in a dry and cool place.</li>
